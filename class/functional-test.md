Functional Test
====

> [**Functional testing** verifies each function of an application or software. The tester verifies functionality with a specified set of requirements. So the source code of a software or an application doesnâ€™t play a major role in this case. Testing the behavior of the software is the main concern.](https://www.testim.io/blog/software-testing-basics/)
