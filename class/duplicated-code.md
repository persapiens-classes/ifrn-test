## :hammer: CPD

> [Duplicate code can be hard to find, especially in a large project. But PMDâ€™s Copy/Paste Detector (CPD) can find it for you!](https://pmd.github.io/pmd/pmd_userdocs_cpd.html)

> [CPD works with Java, JSP, C/C++, C#, Go, Kotlin, Ruby, Swift and many more languages. It can be used via command-line, or via an Ant task. It can also be run with Maven by using the cpd-check goal on the Maven PMD Plugin.](https://pmd.github.io/pmd/pmd_userdocs_cpd.html)

## :construction_worker: Task

Create one pull request for your project according to [Task Submission Guidelines.](../assessment.md#task-submission)

Install one duplicated code static analysis tool like pmd/cpd in your project.

Fix **three** different duplicated code issues reported by the static analysis tool. Create a **separate commit** to each duplicated code fixed.
