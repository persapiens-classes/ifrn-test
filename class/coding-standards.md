Coding Standards
====

## :bulb: Definition

According to [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coding_conventions)

> Coding conventions are a set of guidelines for a specific programming language that recommend programming style, practices, and methods for each aspect of a program written in that language. These conventions usually cover file organization, indentation, comments, declarations, statements, white space, naming conventions, programming practices, programming principles, programming rules of thumb, architectural best practices, etc.

## :hammer: Checkstyle

[Checkstyle is a development tool to help programmers write Java code that adheres to a coding standard. It automates the process of checking Java code to spare humans of this boring (but important) task. This makes it ideal for projects that want to enforce a coding standard.](https://checkstyle.sourceforge.io/)

### Install and Run with Visual Code

Use [VSCode Checkstyle for Java](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=shengchen.vscode-checkstyle)

## :construction_worker: Task

Create one pull request for your project according to [Task Submission Guidelines.](../assessment.md#task-submission)
