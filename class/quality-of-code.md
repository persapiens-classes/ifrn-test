Quality of Code

## Maintain code is hard and expensive

According to Barua et All in Paper A Cost Analysis of the Software Dilemma: To Maintain or to Replace:

> Empirical studies [4, 5, 14, 261 report that **systems maintenance consumes** between **50 and 80%** of total IS resources. 

> Lientz, Swanson and Tompkins [14] report that as much as **75% or more of maintenance work** is devoted to adaptive and perfective maintenance for functional modifications and enhancements.

According to Zarnekow et All in Paper Distribution of cost over the application lifecycle-a multi-case study:

> a survey of the life cycle costs of 30 IT application systems...
> 
> For a production time of 5 years these costs amounted to 79% of all life cycle costs, whereas only 21% of the costs were incurred during the planning and initial development stages

## How to improve quality of code?

1. Use static analysis

2. Use tests

3. Secure the code
