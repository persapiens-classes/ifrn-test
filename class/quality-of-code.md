## :scream: Maintain code is hard and expensive

According to Barua et All in Paper A Cost Analysis of the Software Dilemma: To Maintain or to Replace:

> Empirical studies [4, 5, 14, 261 report that **systems maintenance consumes** between **50 and 80%** of total IS resources. 
>
> Lientz, Swanson and Tompkins [14] report that as much as **75% or more of maintenance work** is devoted to adaptive and perfective maintenance for functional modifications and enhancements.

According to Zarnekow et All in Paper Distribution of cost over the application lifecycle-a multi-case study:

> a survey of the life cycle costs of 30 IT application systems...
> 
> For a production time of 5 years these costs amounted to 79% of all life cycle costs, whereas only 21% of the costs were incurred during the planning and initial development stages

## 👍 Use Static Analysis ##

[What Is Static Code Analysis?](https://www.perforce.com/blog/sca/what-static-analysis)

> Static analysis is a method of debugging that is done by automatically examining the source code without having to execute the program. This provides developers with an understanding of their code base and helps ensure that it is compliant, safe, and secure.

> I. Change is the only constant
> 
> II. Assists Security Analysts
> 
> III. Helps scale at a faster pace
> 
> IV. Finds bugs during early stages of development
> 
> V. Define rules to assist developers

## 🚀 Use Tests ##

> I. They save you hours of debugging
> II. They make you think about your code before/as you write it
> III. They make you write efficient code the first time
> IV. They give you documentation for the application
> V. They help keep deployments smooth
