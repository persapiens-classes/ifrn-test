Test Overview
====

> [Software testing can be stated as the process of verifying and validating whether a software or application is bug-free, meets the technical requirements as guided by its design and development, and meets the user requirements effectively and efficiently by handling all the exceptional and boundary cases.](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/software-testing-basics/) 

## Verification and Validation ##

> **Verification**: “Are we building the product right?” 
>
> It refers to the set of tasks that ensure that the software correctly implements a specific function. 
>
> **Validation**: “Are we building the right product?”
>
> It refers to a different set of tasks that ensure that the software that has been built is traceable to customer requirements.

## Manual and Automation ##

> **Manual testing** includes testing software manually, i.e., without using any automation tool or any script.
>
> **Automation testing**, which is also known as Test Automation, is when the tester writes scripts and uses another software to test the product.

## Black Box and White Box ##

> **Black Box Testing**: The technique of testing in which the tester doesn’t have access to the source code of the software and is conducted at the software interface without any concern with the internal logical structure of the software is known as black-box testing.
>
> **White-Box Testing**: The technique of testing in which the tester is aware of the internal workings of the product, has access to its source code, and is conducted by making sure that all internal operations are performed according to the specifications is known as white box testing. 

## Functional and Non-Functional ##

> [**Functional testing** verifies each function of an application or software. The tester verifies functionality with a specified set of requirements. So the source code of a software or an application doesn’t play a major role in this case. Testing the behavior of the software is the main concern.](functional-test.md)
> 
> [**Non-functional testing** considers parameters such as reliability, usability, and performance. A non-functional test might be checking how many users can log in to the system at the same time.](non-functional-test.md)
